# EVEN-ODD-FILE-CREATOR
*This program is written in Python language. This algorithm generates a text file containing 20 integers. Then sorts the integers whether it is even or odd.*

> This project is created by me because of two reasons. First, this project is a university requirement. The second and last reason, I authored this program is to learn and explore more in the field of programming
Project Description
This program will generate 20 integers and save them to a text file named numbers.txt. The program will then read the numbers.txt and will sort the integers from that file whether it is odd or even. All of the even integers from numbers.txt will be appended to another text file named even.txt. While all odd integers will be appended to another file named odd.txt. The terminal will also show the integers generated and the description of each integer.

## How to Use?
>**To use this program:**
>1. The user will be needing to download the file.
>2. Once downloaded, open the file with any type of Python Integrated Development Environment or IDE and run the program.
>3. Next, once the program is running, the console will print the description of the program. You will be asked to type in any key to continue.
>4. After entering, the program will generate your set of integers
>5. Then, the program will ask the user for a message and a keyword.
>6. After generating the numbers, the console will print the integers generated.
>7. Right below the list of integers, the console will display the set of integers generated and their type(odd or even)
>8. The program is done. You will be asked to check your directory for the files created. There should be three (3) files made in total.

## Reminder:
>Since the program generates a unique set of 20 integers every time it runs, make sure to delete or place the files created on your last run before running the program again for the nth time.
